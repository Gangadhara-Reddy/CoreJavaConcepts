	 * Encapsulation- data binding/wrapping data and mehtods into a single unit/capsule.
	 * it is actually like a capsule where u r binding data and methods -
	 *  -all together and you are forming up an ineterdependency between them
	 *  This is actually used to provide security.So security interms of data hinding and abstraction
	 *  data hiding - hiding the data from outside world(outside world is other classes.) so that they are not direclty accessable.
	 *  Abstraction - force calling those varibales using methods.menas using mehtods,we should be able to access..So interaction is not
	 *  direct but it should be with the help of sdome mehtod like getter and setter mehtods.
